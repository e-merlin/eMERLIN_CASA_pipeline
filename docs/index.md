The e-MERLIN CASA Pipeline (eMCP) is a python pipeline working on top of CASA to process and calibrate interferometric data from the e-MERLIN array. Access to data information, statistics and assessment plots on calibration tables and visibilities can be accessed by the pipeline weblog, which is updated in real time as the pipeline job progresses. The output is calibrated data and preliminary lookup images of the relevant fields. It can calibrate mixed mode data that includes narrow-band high spectral resolution spectral windows for spectral lines, and also special observing modes as pseudo-wideband observations. Currently no polarization calibration is performed.
